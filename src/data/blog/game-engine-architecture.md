# Modern Game Engine Architecture

Game engines are complex pieces of software that require careful architectural design to be maintainable, extensible, and performant. In this post, I'll cover some key architectural patterns used in modern game engines.

## Entity Component System (ECS)

The Entity Component System (ECS) is a popular architectural pattern in game development that provides a flexible way to define game objects:

- **Entities** are unique identifiers representing game objects
- **Components** store data but have no behavior
- **Systems** process entities with specific components

This approach allows for great composition and avoids deep inheritance hierarchies.

## Data-Oriented Design

Modern game engines are moving away from traditional object-oriented programming toward data-oriented design:

- Group data by access patterns
- Optimize for cache coherency
- Process data in batches
- Use Struct of Arrays (SoA) rather than Array of Structures (AoS) when appropriate

## Event Systems

Robust event systems are crucial for decoupling different parts of the engine:

- Event queues and dispatchers
- Subscription patterns
- Prioritization of events

## Resource Management

Efficient resource loading, caching, and streaming are vital:

- Asset pipelines
- Hot-reloading
- Memory management strategies

In future posts, I'll dive deeper into each of these topics with practical C++ examples.
