Portfolio Website Design Document
1. Website Title: Ronit Shah - Portfolio

2. Core Theme: Calm and Warm - Evoking the feeling of sitting beneath a tree on a warm day with a gentle breeze and the distant sound of waves.

3. Target Audience: Potential employers, collaborators, and other developers interested in your game development skills, particularly in low-level areas.

4. Overall Aesthetic: Clean, minimalist, professional, and subtly evocative of the core theme through color and very subtle visual cues. Avoid anything overly flashy or distracting.

5. Font:
* Primary: Trojan Pro - To be used for main headings, navigation links, and potentially short, impactful text elements. Ensure it is properly implemented (local file or web font).
* Secondary (Fallback/Body): A clean and readable sans-serif font (e.g., Open Sans, Lato, Montserrat, Source Sans Pro) for longer text blocks in the Projects and Blog sections to ensure readability.

7. Main Page Design:

* **7.1. Hero Section (Initial Viewport - ~25% of screen height):**
    * **Main Title:** Your Name (`<h1>` tag) in a large size using Trojan Pro.
    * **"Game Area Reached" Inspiration:** Subtle prefix and suffix symbols around your name. Design simple, elegant symbols that relate to code or your personal brand (e.g., `[]`, `//`, a stylized `<>`, or a single pixel). Style these in the primary accent color.
    * **Initial State:** Name and symbols centered.
    * **Scroll Transition:** Upon scrolling, the main name smoothly reduces in size and transitions to a fixed position at the top of the viewport, potentially becoming part of the navigation bar or sitting just above it. The initial space it occupied can then reveal the introductory tagline.
    * **Introductory Tagline:** A concise tagline (e.g., "Low-Level Game Developer," "Building Immersive Experiences") appearing below the initial name as the user starts to scroll. Use a smaller size of Trojan Pro or the fallback sans-serif.

* **7.2. Navigation Bar:**
    * Fixed to the top of the viewport after the hero section transition (or always visible below the initial hero).
    * Links: Projects, Blog, Contact, About.
    * Font: Trojan Pro.
    * Style: Clean and minimal, potentially with a subtle background color from the palette or transparent initially. Hover effects should be clear but not distracting (e.g., a color change of the link text).

* **7.3. Projects Section:**
    * Grid or list layout to showcase projects.
    * Project titles in Trojan Pro.
    * Brief descriptions in the fallback sans-serif.
    * Visuals (thumbnails/screenshots) as appropriate.
    * **Emphasis on Low-Level Aspects:** For each project, explicitly highlight any involvement in areas like engine architecture, memory management, graphics programming (API used), physics implementation, or performance optimization. Use clear and concise language.

* **7.4. Blog Section:**
    * List of recent blog post titles (Trojan Pro) with short excerpts (fallback sans-serif) and links to full posts.

* **7.5. Contact Section:**
    * Heading (Trojan Pro).
    * Simple contact form or clear display of your email address.

* **7.6. Footer:**
    * Copyright information and any other relevant links in a subtle font and color.
8. Other Pages (Conceptual):

* **Blog Page:** Clean layout for reading blog posts. Main content in the fallback sans-serif, headings in Trojan Pro.
* **Project Detail Page (Optional):** More in-depth information about individual projects.
* **About Page:** Information about you, your background, and your passion for game development, particularly low-level aspects. Use a readable layout with Trojan Pro for headings and the fallback sans-serif for body text.
* **Contact Page:** Dedicated page for the contact form and other contact information.
9. Visual Elements (Subtle):

* **Background:** A solid color from the chosen palette (the base color is a good starting point). Consider very subtle textures (e.g., a faint noise pattern or a soft gradient) if it enhances the calm feeling without being distracting. Avoid strong imagery or patterns.
* **Icons (Optional):** Simple, minimalist icons for navigation or to represent skills (used sparingly).
10. Interactivity:

* Smooth scrolling.
* Clear and subtle hover effects on links and interactive elements.
* The hero section scroll transition as described in 7.1.
11. Responsiveness:

* The website must be fully responsive and adapt seamlessly to different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile). Use media queries to adjust layout, font sizes, and spacing as needed.
12. Low-Level Developer Emphasis:

* Explicitly mention low-level skills and experiences within project descriptions and potentially in an "About" or "Skills" section.
* The clean and efficient design aesthetic can subtly reflect a technical mindset.
